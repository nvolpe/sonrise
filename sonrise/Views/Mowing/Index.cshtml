                    Sonrise Sprinklers offers the highest quality lawn mowing service for your Fort Collins or Loveland home. 
                    Mowing with large riding or standing lawn equipment is a shortcut that most turf management companies take. 
                    This compacts the soil and puts risk on damaging borders and landscape. We use 21” double bladed push mowers 
                    for proper lawn maintenance. We sharpen our blades daily. By ensuring that the grass blades are cut cleanly 
                    instead of tearing the blades, the grass can heal quickly and prevent the introduction of disease. By changing 
                    directions in our mowing patterns each week, we prevent ruts and matted turf. Our Fort Collins lawn 
                    mowing service also includes bagging and removing the clippings to prevent disease and leave your turf with a top 
                    notch appearance. Our lawn service includes edging the concrete every visit as well as trimming all boarders. We 
                    are sure to blow off any concrete, pathways, and all other places grass may have fallen during our visit to your home. 
                    All of our equipment meets environmental emission standards. We offer weekly and, bi-weekly lawn maintenance, 
                    along with one time services. Commit to a season long, weekly mowing plan and we will give you a free spring fertilization!
