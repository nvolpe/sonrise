                    Our snow removal plans are completely customizable.  You can tailor a plan to fit your every need.
                    We have a 24 hour emergency phone line so that you can always feel comfortable calling.  We do
                    not use truck plows on your driveway.  This protects your concrete, landscape, and even your
                    garage door!  We use shovels whenever possible to reduce risk of damaged property and the
                    development of ice after our visit it your home.  Our boarder to boarder method leaves your property
                    with the curb appeal that it deserves.  You pick a custom minimum depth before service.  You also
                    have the option of picking a custom time of completion so that you don’t get stuck in the driveway
                    backing out of your garage trying to go to work.  We also offer the option to lay ice melt on any of
                    your patios, sidewalks, and driveways.  We are not responsible for any slips or falls after our visit to
                    your home.
