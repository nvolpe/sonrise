                    High Efficiency 
                    <strong>Nozzles</strong>

                <p>
                    High efficiency nozzles have become the standard and set a new bar in turf irrigation.  By using
                    multiple rotating streams the water can be applied more slowly.  This allows the water more time to
                    penetrate the soil and soak into the root bed.  This prevents runoff and evaporation.  Installing high
                    efficiency nozzles is the best investment you can make on your irrigation system.  The cities of
                    Greeley and Fort Collins water districts will credit your next water bill just for installing these new
                    nozzles for your turf.  They can cover a much wider range than traditional nozzles as well.  They are
                    a great fix for water pressure issues, brown spots, poor coverage, and high runoff from clay soils and
                    slopes.  Call us today for a free estimate to change your system into a high efficiency system that
                    will conserve water and start saving you money by the end of the summer!
